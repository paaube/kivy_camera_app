<h1>Camera app using Python and Kivy</h1>

<h2>Goal: Build a simple camera app to learn the basics of GUI using Python</h2>

<p>

In this project, I used Kivy to build a simple camera app. It cointains 2 screens: on the first screen, the app welcomes the user and displays a button labelled "Take a picture". When it is pressed, it displays another screen with a live view of the webcam in the middle, a button to go back to the Welcome screen and a button to take the photo. When this button is pressed, it saves the current image as "photo.png" in the same folder as the source code.
</p>

In the folder named "kivy_practice", I included some tests I made before building the final app. It includes a login example, a script to access the webcam, an example of an app with multiple screens and a popup test.
